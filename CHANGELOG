Changes in Tony 1.0 since the previous release 0.6:

 * The underlying pYin analysis plugin has been updated; more analysis
   options are available

 * Notes can be dragged up and down using the mouse in edit mode. When
   you drag a note, the pitch track underneath it snaps to the nearest
   spectral peaks (if any are found). Releasing the note makes the
   note snap back to the (possibly now moved) underlying pitch values.

 * Exported pitch track CSV files now contain one row for every
   processing frame in the file, and those with no identified pitch
   have the pitch recorded as 0. This is useful for some evaluation
   and post-processing tools, and it's easier to filter out the 0
   values if you don't need them than add them afterwards if you do

 * Exported note track CSV files now omit the (meaningless, in this
   context) velocity column

 * Level and pan for a layer (audio, pitch track, notes) are now shown
   in a little matrix widget, which is quicker to read than the
   previous pair of rotary dials; click on it to pop up an editable
   version

 * Horizontal scrolling using a Mac trackpad now works properly

 * Tony now finds plugins in its own installation directory by default
   (can be overridden with TONY_VAMP_PATH environment variable)

 * Bug fixes

Changes in Tony 0.6 since the previous release 0.5:

 * The play pointer no longer tracks to the centre of the main pane
   when dragging, and is now always visible. Play pointer / playhead
   behaviour is generally expected to be much more sensible and
   intuitive in this release than in prior ones

 * Many keyboard shortcuts have been added and improved, including the
   shortcuts for incremental note-by-note selection and moving the
   play pointer

 * Audio files are now implicitly normalised to peak == 1.0 when
   loading

 * Tony now has an Analysis menu which contains various configuration
   settings that affect pitch analysis

 * There is now an option to save the session directly to the same
   directory as the original audio file, for rapid saving when
   annotating many audio files in sequence

 * The extents of the "active" note are now more clearly shown when
   mousing over the note track

 * There is a new function to delete the notes (without deleting pitch
   measurements) within the selection

 * Numerous bug fixes

Changes in Tony 0.5 since the previous release 0.4:

 * The start and end of the recording are now shaded in grey so you
   can see where they are

 * There are new save/open session functions on the File menu; the
   session file extension is .ton, and save/open session should work

 * The note edit tool (which was largely broken in 0.4 after lots of
   work on pitch track editing) now works again

 * New note editing menu actions: split note, merge notes, form note
   from selection, snap notes to pitch track

 * Editing the pitch track (when notes are present) causes the notes
   to be automatically updated to the new pitch track

 * The Key and Mouse Reference help window has been updated so as to
   show Tony-specific actions properly

 * The undo/redo command bundling has been tidied up and some related
   crashes fixed
	
Changes in Tony 0.4 since the previous release 0.3:

 * The main pitch tracker (pYIN) now uses a non-FFT Yin method in
   order to produce unbiased timestamps

 * Pitch estimation within a constrained frequency range now uses a
   harmonic spectrum plugin (CHP) that tracks peaks within the range
   in a way more in line with user expectations than pYIN

 * The layer show/hide controls have been merged into the layer type
   icons, saving toolbar space

 * Adjustment of the displayed frequency range has been crudely added

 * Fix crash on loading a second file and inability to export pitch
   track after using selection strip

Changes in Tony 0.3 since the previous release 0.2:

 * Key shortcuts for editing have been revised to be more consistent
   on OS/X and across different Qt versions

 * Reduce visual clutter in selection areas

 * Fixes to OS/X deployment

Changes in Tony 0.2 since the previous release 0.1:

 * Waveform is now displayed in a shadow layer at bottom of main pane

 * A selection strip has been added at the bottom of the window, so
   selections can be made without changing tool mode

 * Double-click in selection strip now selects a region associated
   with a single note

 * Pitches can be moved up and down by octaves, and to different pitch
   candidates, within the selected area

 * Cancelling a selection by hitting Esc restores the pre-selection
   pitch track

 * A frequency range can be selected with shift-click in the main
   window to prompt the pitch tracker to run only within that range

 * Arbitrary-frequency playback and pitch track resynthesis now supported

 * Layers can now be hidden, and playback toggled, individually, and
   there are now gain and pain controls for each playable layer type
