These Dockerfiles create images that contain .deb builds for
Tony. That is, the entire build is run in the process of creating the
image, and the resulting image contains the built .deb file in the
/opt/tony directory.

Run:

sudo docker build -t tony:build-v1.0-amd64 64
sudo docker build -t tony:build-v1.0-i386 32

to create images ("docker images" lists them) with the builds in them.
