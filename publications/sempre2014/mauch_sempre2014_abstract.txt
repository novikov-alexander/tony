Matthias Mauch and Chris Cannam: Efficient Computer-Aided Pitch Track and Note Estimation for Scientific Applications

Abstract.
We present **Tony**, a free, open-source software tool for 
computer-aided pitch track and note annotation of melodic audio content.
The accurate annotation of fundamental frequencies 
per time instant and per note
is essential to the scientific study of 
intonation in singing (and other instruments).
Unlike commercial applications for singers and producers 
or other academic tools for generic music annotation and visualisation
**Tony** has been designed for the scientific study of monophonic music:
a) it implements state-of-the art algorithms for pitch and note estimation from audio,
b) it provides a graphical user interface, including auditory feedback of pitch and note tracks, 
through which the user can identify and rapidly correct estimation errors,
c) it exports the pitch track and note track for further use in spreadsheets or post-processing.
Software versions for Windows, OSX and Linux platforms can be downloaded from

Aims.
We aim to make scientific annotation of intonation more efficient.
Music psychologists interested in the analysis of pitch and intonation 
usually use software programs originally aimed at the analysis of speech
(e.g. Praat http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) or generic audio annotation
tools (e.g. Sonic Visualiser http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/)
to extract pitches of notes from audio recordings. 
Since these programs were not conceived for musical pitch analysis, 
the process of extracting note frequencies remains laborious and can take
many times the duration of the recording.
On the other hand, commercial tools such as
Melodyne (http://www.celemony.com/), Songs2See (http://www.songs2see.com/) or 
Sing&See (http://www.singandsee.com/) have 
unknown frequency estimation procedures (proprietary code)
and do not provide export formats needed for scientific analysis.
An academic note annotation system [1] exists, but does not feature 
note extraction. It is also not openly available.
This is why, during our own research on intonation [2], 
we decided to code our own pitch extraction tool that would avoid the shortcomings.

Methods.
For automatic pitch estimation we use the pYIN method [3]. 
The method provides precise pitch and note estimates and 
automatically determines which parts of the recording are voiced.
The graphical user interface is based upon the 
open source software libraries from Sonic Visualiser. 
We simplified the interface and added the capability for playing back 
not only the original audio, but also sonifications of the pitch track 
(melody line) 
and the note track (discrete pitches with durations).
Notes' pitches are robustly estimated as the median of the pitch track
that occurs during the duration of the note.
The user can delete, move, cut, merge, crop and extend notes, 
and the note's frequency is adapted accordingly.
The user can delete spurious parts of the pitch track 
and shift the pitch track in frequency.
In order to correct erroneous pitch tracks, the user can select 
a time interval, and **Tony** will provide various alternative 
pitch tracks the user can select from.

Outcomes.
The system is currently being used for two projects:
for the generation of new training and test data for Music Informatics research, 
and for a new project on intonation in unaccompanied solo singing.
Preliminary feedback by the users suggests that 
the system does indeed facilitate pitch annotation 
and provides vital features that cannot be found in other tools.

Title for final section.
Conclusions

[Q37].
We presented **Tony** a new software tool for computer-assisted
annotation of melodic audio content for scientific analysis.
No other existing program combines pitch and note estimation, 
a graphical user interface with auditory feedback,
rapid, computer-aided correction of pitches and
and extensive exporting facilities.
**Tony** is freely available for use on Windows, OSX and Linux platforms
from http://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/tony/.
